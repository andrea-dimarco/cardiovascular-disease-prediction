In this project we analyzed patient medical and personal data to create a trajectory of events and try to predict whether the patient is going to have a cardiovascular disease in the next six months. We modeled a number of approaches both in the system architecture and the patientsâ€™ trajectory definition, including LSTM architecture, T-LSTM, Transformer architecture and Bayesian Optimization on the Transformer architecture without Positional Encoding. We concluded that the best algorithm for this task is the Transformer model with optimized hyper-parameters since it focuses more on the events rather than the order of said events, thanks to the Attention Matrix mechanism.
